## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I started by building out the desktop version first, which I will talk more in the Lessons Learned section. After building out the desktop version I built the responsive version. It was a journey of styling, responsiveness and implementing different functionality, like the running clock that is localized to the user on the homepage.

## Optimizations

Have an option where users can fill out a template for their own favourite trees, a photo of the tree as well as some facts about it

## Lessons Learned:

I learned to use the mobile design strategy rather than the responsive design strategy in future projects. I learned that building the desktop version first and then shrinking everything down to fit many different mobile screens utilizes way more time, rather than building out the mobile design first and then building up to the desktop version. All in all it was a great learning experience!
