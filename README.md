This project focuses on my passion of nature and a few trees that i love!

The opening page is an introduction to the page, an explanation of why i am passionate about trees and what they do for our earth and world daily.

On the trees page, it shows the 5 trees that this website will focus on Arborvitae, Honey Locust, Birch, Black Oak and Red Maple.

Each individual tree page, gives an overview of different aspects that trees need to survive, best practices of planting, watering and growing.

There is a social page with my personal links.

On each page, there is an option to return back to the home page.
