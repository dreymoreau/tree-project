            <h3>Basics about Red Maple trees</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>Living:</span>
                    <p>The most important aspect about the red maple is its capability to survive in almost any kind of soil type.</p>
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <span>Height:</span>
                    <p> Usually the tree reaches a height of 18-27 meters, and the leaves of a matured tree are 9-11 cm in size. 
                        Some species have even shown a growth of up to 35 m.
                    </p>
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    <span>Maturity:</span>
                     <p>The tree hits its maturity at the age of 70-80 years. The reason the red maple is able to adapt to a variety of 
                        habitats is its nature to suit the soil from a very young age with the help of its roots.
                    </p>

                <li>
                    <span>Beginner:</span>
                    <p>
                        The red maple is among the first trees to bloom in spring.</p>
