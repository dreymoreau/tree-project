            <h3>Basics about Arborvitae trees</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                     <span>Growing Height:</span>
                         <p>Some low-growing shrubs are under 3 feet tall. Large trees can exceed heights of 70 feet and widths of 25 feet.</p>
                 </li>

                <li>
                    <span>Shapes:</span>
                        <p>Mounded, conical, pyramidal, rounded, or pendulous, depending on the cultivar.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <span>Foliage:</span>
                     <p>
                         Most arborvitaes have flattened, lacy aromatic needles, ranging from emerald green to gold. 
                         Clusters of rosebud-shaped cones measuring about Â½ inch long appear in early summer, turning from green to nutmeg-brown.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <span>Growth rate:</span>
                     <p>
                         Growth rate varies depending on the species and cultivar. Some are very fast growers adding 3 to 4 feet per year, 
                         while others, such as dwarfs and miniatures, grow much slower.
                    </p>
