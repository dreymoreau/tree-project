                    <span>Growing:</span>
                    <p> Birch trees grow best in locations where their foliage gets 
                        full sun for at least six hours a day.
                    </p>

                    <span>Necessary for it to Grow:</span>
                    <p> Birch trees require moist soil and need a lot of watering in 
                        the summer months during the first year of active growth. You should water your 
                        birch tree generously for at least two to three hours a week in total.
                    </p>
