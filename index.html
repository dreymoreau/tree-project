    <!-- thoughts about trees, why they are important to me and the world -->
    <section class="intro-desc">
        <p> On this webpage, I will talk about a few of my favourite trees. I am really fascinated by trees, the way they grow, 
            the way they are constantly changing, shifting, going through different phases of life and rebirth, as they move through different seasons. 
            As humans, we can relate lots with trees by the different cycles they are constantly going through, as we are constantly going through different
            cycles. The only difference, is that the seasons we go through may be outside of a calender time. Some seasons may
            last a day, a week, some may last a month, a few months, a year, or much longer. Thats really up to how we are being Guided
            through day to day moments of life. I hope this webpage can help share the beauty of trees and how we need to do as much
            as we can while we are here to help the trees grow and flourish, rather than continue to destroy, remove but never replace
            them.

                toxic energys that are produced through daily transportation. It also talks about how trees provide water
                to the earth. How magical !!!! LETS PROTECT OUR TREES !!!!
